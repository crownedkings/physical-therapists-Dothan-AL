README

Hey, I started creating a website for my physical therapist. I am using Rails, even though I still have a lot to learn about the whole process. I heard that Rails websites get indexed faster and some people even claim that the search engines like them more than sites built on other platforms. That remains to be seen.

I'm not used to working with command prompt, but I just installed Bash on Ubuntu, so there's no turning back. :)

These [physical therapists Dothan, AL](http://legacytherapyandwellness.com/) are great people, I talked to this guy named Mark and he offered me a lot of solid advice. Hope I can make it up to him by working on this project. I'll ask you guys for help in case I can't handle it, I'm sure there are many tricky things to deal with.
